# ⚡ Forecasting Renewable Energy Production & Electricity Demand

This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast **solar (PV) production**, **wind production**, and **electricity demand** using real-world renewable energy and weather data.

The dataset spans **3 years (2019–2021)** and includes key environmental variables such as solar irradiance (DHI, DNI, GHI), wind speed, humidity, temperature, and more.  
The goal is to build reliable forecasting models that support renewable energy planning and grid stability.
